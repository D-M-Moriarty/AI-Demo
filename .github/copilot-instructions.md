# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Java Demo Project

This is a Java demonstration project for showcasing GitHub Copilot Chat capabilities.

## Project Context
- **Language**: Java 11+
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Testing Framework**: JUnit 5
- **Purpose**: Demonstrating Copilot Chat workflows

## Code Style Preferences
- Use clear, descriptive variable and method names
- Include JavaDoc comments for public methods
- Follow standard Java naming conventions
- Prefer explicit over implicit when it aids readability
- Follow one class per file convention (except for inner classes with specific purpose)
- Each public class should have its own .java file matching the class name

## Common Use Cases for This Demo
1. **Code Explanation**: Ask Copilot to explain complex methods or algorithms
2. **Test Generation**: Generate comprehensive unit tests with edge cases
3. **Code Refactoring**: Improve existing code structure and readability
4. **Bug Fixing**: Help identify and resolve issues in the codebase
5. **Documentation**: Generate or improve JavaDoc comments

## Demonstration Scenarios
This project is specifically designed for live demonstrations of:
- How Copilot Chat explains existing code
- Generating unit tests from existing methods
- Refactoring and optimization suggestions
- Debugging assistance through conversational AI
