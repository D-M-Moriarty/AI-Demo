# Scenario 2: Project README Generation

## Demo Flow (2.5 minutes)

### 1. Opening Prompt (45 seconds)
```
I have this Java project with data processing capabilities. Can you analyze the codebase and generate a comprehensive README.md file that explains what this project does, how to use it, and how to get started?
```

### 2. Follow-up Prompt 1 (45 seconds)
```
Now generate a README section focused on developers who want to contribute to this project. Include architecture overview, coding standards, and how to add new features.
```

### 3. Follow-up Prompt 2 (45 seconds)
```
Create a quick start guide for this project that gets a new user from zero to running the application in under 5 minutes.
```

### 4. Specific Audience Prompt (45 seconds)
```
Generate project documentation for non-technical stakeholders that explains the business value and capabilities of this data processing system.
```
Generate project documentation for non-technical stakeholders that explains the business value and capabilities of this data processing system.
```

## Backup Talking Points
- "Notice how Copilot understands the entire project structure, not just individual files"
- "It automatically identifies the key features by analyzing the code"
- "Same codebase, different README documentation for different audiences"
- "This saves me hours of README writing and keeps project documentation in sync with code"
- "Perfect for onboarding new developers or explaining projects to stakeholders"

## Alternative Prompts (if needed)
```
Add a troubleshooting section to this README with common issues and solutions.
```

```
Generate a CONTRIBUTING.md file that explains our development workflow and pull request process.
```

```
Create deployment documentation for this project including Docker setup and environment configuration.
```

```
Write installation instructions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux).
```

## Context to Mention
- Point out the multi-scenario project structure
- Mention this represents a real microservice or library  
- Show how Copilot analyzes imports, dependencies, and code patterns to understand the project
- Emphasize the "living documentation" aspect - README stays current with code changes
- Highlight time savings: "This would normally take hours to write manually"
- Demo different audiences: technical vs business stakeholders
