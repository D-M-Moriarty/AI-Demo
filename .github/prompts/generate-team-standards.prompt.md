# Team Standards Generator

Generate comprehensive coding standards and best practices documentation for this project that a development team can follow.

## Required Sections:
- **Coding Conventions**: Naming, formatting, and structural guidelines
- **Architecture Patterns**: Design patterns used in this codebase
- **Testing Standards**: Unit testing, integration testing, and code coverage requirements
- **Code Review Guidelines**: What to look for during code reviews
- **Git Workflow**: Branch naming, commit message format, PR requirements
- **Documentation Requirements**: When and how to document code

## Analysis Instructions:
- Examine existing code to identify current patterns and conventions
- Reference industry best practices for Java development
- Consider Maven project structure and dependencies
- Include specific examples from this codebase
- Focus on consistency and maintainability

## Output Format:
Create a structured document that can serve as:
- Onboarding guide for new team members
- Reference during code reviews
- Foundation for automated linting rules
- Living document that evolves with the project

Include code examples and rationale for each standard to help developers understand the "why" behind each guideline.
