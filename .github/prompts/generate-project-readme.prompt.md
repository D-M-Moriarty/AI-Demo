# Project README Generator

Analyze this entire codebase using the codebase tool and generate a comprehensive README.md file that explains what this project does, how to use it, and how to get started.

## Requirements:
- **Project Overview**: Clear description of purpose and capabilities
- **Installation Instructions**: Prerequisites, setup steps, and build commands  
- **Usage Examples**: Code snippets showing how to use key features
- **Architecture**: High-level design and key components
- **Contributing**: Guidelines for developers wanting to contribute
- **Documentation Structure**: Professional formatting with clear sections

## Target Audiences:
1. **New Developers**: Clear onboarding and setup instructions
2. **Contributors**: Architecture overview and development guidelines  
3. **Users**: Usage examples and feature descriptions
4. **Stakeholders**: Business value and project capabilities

## Analysis Instructions:
- Use the codebase tool to examine the complete project structure
- Identify key features from all Java classes and their relationships
- Understand dependencies from pom.xml
- Recognize design patterns across all scenarios
- Extract usage patterns from test files and demo scripts

Generate professional, comprehensive documentation that would typically take hours to write manually.
