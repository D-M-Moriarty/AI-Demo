## **Slide 5: Our Approach - Version Controlled Standards**
```
The .github/ Folder Magic

.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ copilot-instructions.md      ‚Üê Workspace standards
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ refactor-legacy-code.prompt.md

‚úÖ Basic understanding of prompt engineering
‚úÖ Team buy-in for standardization

Works with:
‚Ä¢ Any programming language
‚Ä¢ Any project size
‚Ä¢ GitHub Enterprise or public repos
‚Ä¢ Existing development workflows
```

---

## **Slide 10: Success Metrics**
```
Measuring Impact

Immediate (Week 1-2):
‚Ä¢ Consistent prompt quality across team
‚Ä¢ Faster onboarding for new developers

```

---

## **Slide 11: Common Questions**
```
FAQ

Q: "How do we get started?"
A: Create .github/copilot-instructions.md first, 
   build prompt files as needs arise

Q: "Do prompt files work everywhere?"  
A: Yes - any VS Code with Copilot extension

Q: "Can we customize for our tech stack?"
A: Absolutely - modify instructions for your 
   languages/frameworks

Q: "What if team resists standardization?"
A: Start small, show value, let results speak
```

## **Slide 14: Backup - Enterprise Considerations**
```
Enterprise Implementation

Security:
‚úÖ Prompt files are code - same security model
‚úÖ No sensitive data in prompts
‚úÖ Works with GitHub Enterprise

Governance:
‚úÖ Centralized AI interaction standards
‚úÖ Audit trail of AI usage patterns
‚úÖ Controlled evolution of practices

Scalability:
‚úÖ Works across multiple teams/projects
‚úÖ Standards can inherit/extend

## **Slide 15: Backup - Technical Deep Dive**
```
How It Works

copilot-instructions.md:
‚Ä¢ Sets context for entire workspace
‚Ä¢ Defines coding standards and preferences
‚Ä¢ Automatically applied to all AI interactions

prompt files (.prompt.md):
‚Ä¢ Reusable AI agents for specific tasks
‚Ä¢ Reference via #file: syntax in chat
‚Ä¢ Can combine multiple files in single prompt

Result: Consistent, high-quality AI assistance
across entire development team
```

## **üìù SLIDE NOTES FOR PRESENTER**

### **General Presentation Tips**:
- **Slide 2**: Wait for hands, acknowledge current Copilot users
- **Slide 4**: This is your roadmap - refer back if running long
- **Slide 6**: This is your transition to demo - keep energy high
- **Slide 7**: These are your key selling points - emphasize based on audience
- **Slide 11**: Have real answers ready, not just what's on slide

### **Audience Adaptations**:

**For Developers**:
- Focus on Slides 7, 9, 15 (technical benefits and implementation)
- Spend more time on demo, less on business case
- Be ready for deep technical questions

**For Team Leads**:
- Emphasize Slides 7, 8, 10 (team benefits and implementation)
- Focus on standardization and knowledge scaling
- Address change management concerns

**For Managers**:
- Lead with Slides 7, 10, 13 (business value and ROI)
- Keep demo brief, focus on outcomes
- Emphasize enterprise governance aspects

### **Backup Slide Usage**:
- **Slide 13**: Use if asked about business justification
- **Slide 14**: Use for enterprise/security questions  
- **Slide 15**: Use for technical implementation questions

### **Timing Guidance**:
- **Slides 1-5**: 2 minutes total (setup and context)
- **Slide 6**: Transition to demo (30 seconds)
- **Demo**: 8 minutes (refer to script)
- **Slides 7-12**: 3 minutes (wrap-up and Q&A)
- **Backup slides**: As needed during Q&A

### **Visual Design Notes**:
- Use your company's PowerPoint template
- Include company logo on title slide
- Keep bullet points concise - slides support speech, don't replace it
- Use consistent color scheme for code blocks/file structures
- Consider adding screenshots from the actual demo files

### **Interaction Points**:
- **Slide 2**: Actual poll - wait for response
- **Slide 6**: "Any questions before we dive into the demo?"
- **Slide 11**: "What questions do you have?"
- **Slide 12**: "What would be your team's first use case?"

**Remember**: Slides are backup to your demo, not the main show. Keep them simple and use them to frame the live coding demonstration.
